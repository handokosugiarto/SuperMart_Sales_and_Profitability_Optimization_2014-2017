## Insights Deep Dive

### Sales Trends
![Sales Trends](https://github.com/handokosugiarto/SuperMart_Analysis_2014-2017/blob/main/SuperMart%20Sales%20Trends.png)

1. SuperMart's sales performance demonstrates consistent revenue growth, achieving a CAGR 15% from 2014 to 2017. Additionally, sales trends exhibit a clear seasonal pattern with revenue peaking in Q4 each year, driven by an increased in consumer spending during the holiday shopping period in November and December. Notably, sales reached a peak of $280K in Q4 2017, representing a 30% increase from $196K in Q3 2017. While Q4 consistently represents the sales peak period, Q1 marks lowest point of the year, with performance gradually improving in subsequent quarters. On average, sales decline by approximatelly 53% from Q4 to Q1.

Following the seasonal pattern from sales revenue, sales quantity reached their peak in Q4 2017 (5K units sold) while Q1 reached the lowest sales in the year. With a CAGR 18% in sales quantity and 15% in sales revenue, this shows that sales volume is growing faster than revenue, suggesting a decline in average selling price, potentially driven by an increased in discounting or shift toward lower price products. 
3. Profit has taken the same movement as sales revenue over the years. It has shown consistent growh with a CAGR 24% From 2014 to 2017. Despite of its growth movement, profit has reached its highest peak of $38K in Q4 2016, representing 58% increased from $16K in Q3 2016.  
4. Despite consistent growth in sales revenue and profit, Average Order Value (AOV) has shown a fluctuating trends with downward tendencies from Q1 2014 to Q4 2017. At the establishment AOV reached $264 in Q1 2014, representing -13% decreased from $230 in Q4 2017. AOV exhibits a fluctuating trend, reflecting inconsistent customer purchasing behavior and the influence of seasonal or promotional factors.
5.  Profit margin shows quarterly fluctuations over the 2014-2017 period, while demonstrating an overal upward trend, increasing from 5% in Q1 2014 to 10% in Q4 2017. The margin peaked in Q1 2017 at 19% ($24K in profit), compared to 16% in Q4 2016 ($38K in profit).

This growth is driven by an increased in sales volume , which rose from 1986 units to 3411 units over the same period, representing a CAGR 20%. Since the sales volume growth is faster than sales revenue, average selling price has decline that impacts to the revenue growth.

## Recommendation

Based on the uncovered insights, the following recommendations have been provided:

1. Sales Quantity has a CAGR 54% from Q1 2014 to Q4 2017, Sales Revenue's CAGR 43%, AOV's CAGR -4%, Profit's CAGR 66%, And prodit margin has increased from 5% to 10% (5% difference). Those indicators suggest that the revenue growth is driven by the sales volume expansion with the average selling price due to pricing discounting or mix shift which creates pressure to the revenue itself to grow faster. The pressure does not have bad impact to the profits directly but together with cost of good sold, they create pressure to profit margin. **For improvement, suggestion being made to Sales, Product and Finance department to re-evaluate the pricing strategy, discounting strategy, and cost of good sold  to improve profit margin.**
2. Product performance has been performing very well in term of revenue and profit growth overall. Based on finding above, Some of product subcategory are experiencing loss from 2014 to 2017, even though their volume and revenue are still increasing such as Tables (CAGR -38%), Bookcases (CAGR -26%), and Supplies (CAGR -126%).**In order to improve these product subcategory performance, re-evaluation of those products' subcategory are needed. Collaboration with sales, product, and finance department to evaluate the selling price, discounting strategy, cost of good sold, and product replacement to improve profit margin and profit value.**
3. **Collaborate with sales, product, and finance department to re-evaluate pricing strategy, discounting strategy, and cost of good sold for all products that performs well in volume, revenue, and profits but their profit margin is low and some is negative.** For instance phone subcategory : as of Top 10 Best selling product, Samsung Galaxy SIII-16GB-pebble blue with profit margin 1% and Chairs subcategory: HON 5400 Series Task Chairs For Big and Tall with profit margin 0%.
4. **Collaborate with Marketing Department to create marketing programs or campaign to attract New customers segment(less than 3 months) to shop with SuperMart** since they are declining over the time.
5. **Collaborate with marketing department to create loyalty program membership for active and loyal customer segments in order to build customer retention.** This loyalty program membership is expected to maintain customer with lifespan more than 3 months to give them any privilege that will increase spending rate and AOV.
6. **Collaborate with Sales and Marketing department to strengthen West and East existance by maintaining and improving performance of existing outlets. Allocating marketing budget to focus more on to the next potential growing outlets in the West region. Re-evaluate pricing strategy, discounting strategy, and cost of good sold with sales and finance if necessary to achieve higher AOV, profitable revenue with higher profit margin.**
